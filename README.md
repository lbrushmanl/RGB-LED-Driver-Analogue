# RGB-LED-Driver-Analogue
The idea for the project was to make a RGB LED driver so I could use the free LED strip I got from a freind however I wanted it to be fully analogue. It would still alow the user to make any colour they wanted (In practice this was not the case).

VeroBoard Layout (Not my best work just wanted to get somthing working)
